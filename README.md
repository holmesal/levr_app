========

Things to do:

url, query parameter gives back small or large image
		-jpeg compression should yield smaller images
		-width of returned image should be based on largest phone designing for

(cron job)

payment queue checking and smart stuff

ISSUES
========
merchants.py does not have encryption handling

As is, sharing will not work if the deal is not uploaded by a customer.
	- It only pulls CustomerDeals
